Repo for UGA Oxalic Acid collaborative trials on shop towels. Work w/ Ethan Hackmeyer, Jennifer Berry, Geoff Williams, Selina Bruckner

Manyscript accepted as Bartlett et al. 2023 in Journal of Insect Science

Analysis completed in R

Explanation for data set:

'Colony' = a unique colony ID. We screend 200 colonies and included only the healthy ones.
'Yard' = the four experimental sites / apiaries. These are essentially different dields numerous miles from one another
'Treatment' = what was added to the colony. 'CTRL' = nothing added, '0OA' is shot towel with pure glycerine, 'MOA' = medium oxalic, where shop towels and glyercin dosed at 12g of OA total was added, 'HOA' is the same but 18g OA
the treatment factor is broken down into 'GlyercinTowel' (True/False) and oxalic acid dose (in g for whole colony).

'MPB1' - mites per bee timepoint 1 (pre-treatment)

'MPB2' - mites per bee timepoint 2 (post-treatment)
